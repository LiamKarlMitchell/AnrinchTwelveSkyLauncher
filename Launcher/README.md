# InfiniteSky_Launcher
A launcher for the serverside emulator Infinite Sky use able on Twelve Sky

This is still a work in progress.

The idea being it will handle patchs from real server and from your custom server.
It would manage options for the game and ask for username and password.

Launch the game with options and inject the Client DLL.
